# bear_grylls

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In order to use the Microsoft Species Classifier you have to add the config.json file to
the assets folder. You also have to uncomment the '- assets/config.json' line in the
pubspec.yaml file. config.json is in the git ignore file for your safety. :)
